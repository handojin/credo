      <br/><br/>
I believe for optimum health, fitness, and body composition I need:<br/><br/>

• to eat “ZONED” meals. (Balanced and portion-controlled based on one’s macronutrient requirements)<br/>

• to maintain self-awareness and accountability by documenting every food and beverage 
      
consumed. <br/>

• to participate in at least 4 WOD’s per/week.<br/>

• to be accountable to the CrossFit community by posting weekly updates.<br/>
      <br/><br/>

Exceptions:<br/>
      <br/><br/>
For many, absolute adherence is not realistic and often sets one up for failure. Allowing “wiggle 
room” often leads to greater success. <br/><br/>

• I will allow myself <input type="text" id="cheat_meals"/>cheat (no-zone) meals per week. (No more than 3/week recommended.)<br/>

• I will allow myself to consume <input type="text" id="evil_beverages" /> beverages of the alcohol or soda variety. (No more than 3/week recommended.) 
      <br/>
 

• List your exception: (if different than above and discuss it with a trainer) <input type="text" id="personal_exceptions"/>

____________________________________________________________________________
How the Challenge Works:<br/><br/>

Scoring will be composed of the following elements:<br/>

1. Pre- and Post-Challenge WOD improvement in number of reps completed.<br/>

2. Change in body composition based on DEXA scans and body measurements.<br/>

3. Logging your Adherence to the plan:<br/><br/>

Every day, you will give yourself one point if you adhered to the beliefs including your 

exceptions. If you did not, you will give yourself zero points. At the end of every week, you 

will log your total points for the week on a spreadsheet posted in the gym. <br/><br/>

The Rewards!<br/><br/>

The single most significant reward from the Challenge will be better fitness! In addition, you 

could win two free months of unlimited membership to CrossFit 7220. Additional prizes will be 

determined at a later date.<br/><br/>
